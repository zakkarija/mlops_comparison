# MLOps Comparison Thesis

**Overview**  
This repository holds the beginnings of a master’s thesis comparing two end-to-end MLOps stacks:
- **Stack A:** MLflow-centric  
- **Stack B:** Kubeflow-centric  

**Objectives**  
- Implement and demo each stack on a simple time-series anomaly detection workflow  
- Evaluate along key dimensions: usability, flexibility, integration effort, vitality, performance, reliability  
- Produce a comparison matrix and detailed notes per component  

**What’s Next**  
1. Define environments and install prerequisites for MLflow and Kubeflow  
2. Scaffold basic pipelines in `pipelines/`  
3. Run initial “hello world” experiments to validate setup  
4. Document setup steps and early observations in `docs/`  

**Getting Started**  
1. Clone this repo  
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Follow the TODOs in `config/` and `pipelines/` to configure and launch your first run

*This project is in its initial stages—expect more detailed instructions as the stacks take shape.*

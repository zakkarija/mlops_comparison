# ExtremeXP experimentation engine for IDEKO (UC5)

There are two main experiments: binary (*main_binary.xxp*), where binary classication deep learning models are trained, and, multiclass (*main_multiclass.xxp*), where a multiclass classification problem is solved using deep learning models.

5 tasks are defined for both experiments:
1. ReadData
2. PrepareData
3. TrainModel
4. EvaluateModel
5. ValidateModel
